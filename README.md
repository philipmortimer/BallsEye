This repository contains my dissertation on my project, BallsEye. BallsEye is a state-of-the-art AI grassroots football match recorder. Read the [PDF report](PhilipMortimerBallsEye.pdf) for an in depth explanation of the project. The source code is available in the [App Code](App%20Code) folder. This project achieved an exceptional first class grade.

Below is a video taken by BallsEye of a goal. It uses AI to track the ball and film play as it moves around the pitch.

BallsEye uses a gimbal based rotation design as pictured below.
